###1. Anonymity###

We use technologies to anonymously identify your computer or device so we can deliver a better experience. Our systems also log information like your operating system and IP address. However, we do not collect personally identifiable information such as your name, address, phone number or email address. 

We do not knowingly contact or collect personal information from children under 13. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can promptly obtain parental consent or remove the information.

###2. Location data###

To customize our service for you, we and our partners may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of your computer or device. This location data is collected anonymously in a form that does not personally identify you and is used only to provide and improve our service.

We use Google Maps API to enhance the Iron Battles application. Please, see <a href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a> for more information.
