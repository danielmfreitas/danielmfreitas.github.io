###2. Downloading the application###
Once you join our community, if you have not yet done so, head to the Google Play Alpha Test program and accept the terms to become a tester. You can access the program here: [Google Play Alpha Test Program](http://goo.gl/xbmCos "Google Play Alpha Test Program").

Once a member, you will be able to download the application from Google Play: [Download Iron Battles](http://goo.gl/m2fWTS "Download Iron Battles")﻿. Note: you won't be able to find the application through a search since this is a private release.

###3. Providing feedback###
We value your feedback. This is the reason we are going through an alpha and beta release cycles. However, we need you to follow some recommendations when providing feedback.

 * First and most important: this is an alpha release. Not all of the features have been implemented and the application is still in a rough state. Keep that in mind when providing feedback.

 * The focus of this test cycle is on the battle editor and import data utility.

 * To import data from Iron Grudge, first your need to back up your Iron Grudge data. Then just open your file manager of choice, navigate to the IronGrudge directory and click on a file to load. It should launch the Iron Battles application and a notification will be displayed on your Android device while the import is in progress. The application won't be able to access its own data during the import, but the whole process should be fairly quick. I tested the import with [Astro File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.metago.astro "Astro File Manager")﻿, [Tomi File Manager](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tomitools.filemanager "Tomi File Manager")﻿ and the stock Samsung My Files application. The only requirement is that the file ends with a .sav extension.

 * Also important: please do not post app reviews or bugs in the play store during the alpha phase. We will use a tool for that. The play store is not meant to track bugs.

 * If you find a bug, have suggestions or just want to provide general feedback, please head to [http://www.caravelahq.com/b/ironbattles02alpha](http://www.caravelahq.com/b/ironbattles02alpha "http://www.caravelahq.com/b/ironbattles02alpha"). This is the online utility we will use to track user feedback. You can log in with your Google account. The tracker is public and you will not need to request access. However, please fill in your name or PP forum name so we know who we are talking to :).

 * Do not enter tags on the bug editor. We will organize them.

 * Feel free to post on our Alpha Test Community. But avoid reporting bugs there.
