##Iron Battles Android Application Permissions##

We believe transparency is key in developing a good relationship with our users. Nothing annoys us more than applications requesting tons of permissions without any clarification whatsoever of why they need them. You will find below the reasons for each permission we request. You might as well check our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy.html "Iron Batles Privacy Policy").

 * android.permission.INTERNET: That one is kinda obvious isn't it? We do stuff online, so we need to access the Internet.

 * android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE: This permission is required by Google Analytics. Our application itself does not check the network connectivity.

 * com.google.android.providers.gsf.permission.READ_GSERVICES: Required by Google Maps API. Allows the API to access Google web-based services.

 * android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: We write some stuff to disk. We will not, however, erase any files on your device.

 * android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Well, we also need to read some stuff from disk. We only read our own data and data that needs to be imported.

 * android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION: Used when searching for Venue locations close to you.

 * android.permission.READ_LOGS and android.permission.GET_TASKS: This is required by our bug and crash reporting framework. We use this to track application crashes and act fast to resolve bugs.
